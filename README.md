## What's Bicing?

Since 2007 the city of Barcelona has been operating one of the largest bike sharing systems called Bicing. Now, with about 6000 mechanic bikes and 1000 e-bikes distributed in about 400 station across the entire city, it's a 24/7 service with high demand, which makes a lot of sense - mild winters and no bad-weather in Barcelona :)

However, if you have ever tried to go to the beach on the bicing on a Sunday morning, once you finally arrive there, all the stations are likely full, and there’s a line of people waiting to return their bike. Believe me, that's pretty annoying! On the other hand, if you live in north-neighbourhoods of Barcelona, you will probably find your closest station completely empty - very easy to go down the hill but not the other way - uhum. Although there's a public service that collects and brings bikes from full stations to empty ones, the problem still remains there.

With the aim of improving the quality of the service and make it more reliable for the users, in this work I've tried to make predictions about the statuses of the stations of the public bicycle service in Barcelona using publicly available data applying Time Series Analysis and Random Forest Regression models. But, before that, I've deeply analysed and mapped the data in order to observe different patterns and behaviours of each station.

## Open Data BCN

Open Data or Public Sector Information Openness is a movement driven by public administrations with the main objective of maximize available public resources, exposing the information generated or guarded by public bodies, allowing its access and use for the common good and for the benefit of anyone and any entity interested.

The [Open Data BCN](https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/en) service, managed from the Department of Statistics and Data Dissemination of the Municipal Data Office, is transversal to several of the pillars of the city's strategy, is based on the main standards and international recommendations, adopting certain characteristics that summarize the principles of this movement: open data by default, quality and quantity of information, data for the whole world, data to improve governance and promotion of innovation.

- [New Bicing stations status of Barcelona city](https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/en/dataset/estat-estacions-bicing)
- [New Bicing stations information of the city of Barcelona](https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/en/dataset/informacio-estacions-bicing)

The information available in these two datasets is about the current status of the stations: name, wether they are operating normally or not, number of bikes available, number of free slots, etc (`first dataset`). This information is updated almost once a minute. This information has been split into different datasets - one dataset per month (more than 3.000.000 samples per month!). I decided to analyse the month of October of 2019.
Besides the information about the bike system status, I accessed another source of data that contain information about the station itself: location, total capacity, etc (`second dataset`).
